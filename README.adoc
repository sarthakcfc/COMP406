= Open Source Development

== Agenda

=== May 18: Try out open source yourself

NOTE: Don't do this in your repo, for the love of `$deity`

1. Go here: https://github.com/lawrancej/illacceptanything[I'll accept anything that's not illegal-ish]
2. Click the "Fork" button.
3. Clone your fork. `git clone URL-GOES-HERE-BUT-DONT-TYPE-LITERALLY`
4. `cd illacceptanything`
5. Add stuff to the folder.
6. `git add .`
7. `git commit -m "Message here"`
8. `git push origin master`
9. Go to your repository, then submit a pull request.
10. https://github.com/lawrancej/illacceptanything/network[See if it worked here]

=== May 15. Lab 2. Project selection and contribution

With so many open source projects to choose, selecting one can be daunting.

Choose an open source project with:

*Users*::
The more users, the better.
Although contributing to an obscure project may expand the user base,
contributing to a project that people use is a great feeling.
*Utility*::
Does the project serve some user need?
Games are fine, we need entertainment, but some projects are intended for neither users or developers (i.e., toy code).
*Familiarity*::
Can you understand the source code?
If you don't know the language, pass on the project.
*Developers*::
The more developers, the better.
Most open source projects are the work of one person.
You'll get more out of this class if you contribute to projects with multiple developers.
*Activity*::
Have developer(s) contributed to this project recently?
Be wary of inactive projects, unless you want to become the maintainer.

Consider the nature of the contribution you make.
These are excellent contributions:

*New features*::
Creating a new feature to enable users to do something new helps users.
*Bug fixing*::
Fixing some annoying problem helps users.
*Documentation writing*::
Documenting how to build, use or contribute to the code helps users.
*Code cleanup*::
Eradicating technical debt helps the developers, even though it may not affect users.
*Testing*::
Writing a test suite helps the developers.

Consider your motivations.

*Intrinsic interest*::
Would you do this in your spare time anyway? Great!
*Resume / portfolio building*::
Does this contribution advance your career? Great!

Many small isolated commits (that are mergeable) is better than one gigantic commit.

=== May 13. Open source slides

http://flosscc.opensource.org/content/spread-the-word[Open source presentation]

Go to your repo (e.g., on Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab).

Create an issue in your repository.
The issue title should reflect a project you are considering,
the issue description should explain the contribution you want to make.

=== May 11. VMs and Definitions

NOTE: Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ffBJ4sVUb4[Git for ages 4 and up]
and read http://producingoss.com/en/index.html[Producing Open Source Software] by next class.

Install these:

* https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[Virtual Box]
* https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html[Vagrant]

Run this to get into a local Linux (Ubuntu) VM:

----
vagrant init hashicorp/precise32
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
vagrant halt # Shutdown machine (opposite of up)
vagrant destroy # Remove VM (opposite of init)
----

==== What is free software?

https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html[Software with the freedom to]:

* run it for any purpose (freedom 0).
* study how the program works, and change it (freedom 1).
* redistribute copies (freedom 2).
* distribute copies of your modified versions (freedom 3).

Misconceptions about free software:

* You can't sell it. (Yes, you can!)
* Don't need to pay for it. (Sometimes you do)

Free software is NOT necessarily public domain (free of copyrights).
Most free software is protected under copyright.

==== What is open source software?

http://opensource.org/osd-annotated[The open source definition]

* Free Redistribution
* Source Code
* Derived Works
* Integrity of The Author's Source Code
* No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups
* No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor
* Distribution of License
* License Must Not Be Specific to a Product
* License Must Not Restrict Other Software
* License Must Be Technology-Neutral

==== What's the difference?

They're almost the same.
Free software respects *user's* freedom,
whereas open source respects *developer's* freedom.
When users and developers are the same, free and open source mean the same thing.

To understand the difference,
open source digital rights management (DRM) could be a thing,
but free software DRM is a contradiction.

To summarize (courtesy http://www.advogato.org/faq.html[FSF via Advogato]):

==== What does copyleft mean?

Three categories of intellectual property:

* *Patents* protects inventions.
* *Trademarks* protects brands.
* *Copyright* protects other creative works (anything you write)

*Copyleft* flips copyright: you may share as long as you share alike (under the same terms).

==== What does permissive mean?

You can do whatever the f*&@ you want to.

==== What is a license? What's the difference among them?

A *license* restricts what you can do with work under copyright,
it defines the ground rules.

=== May 8. Lab 1: Prequiz

NOTE: Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k84FMc1GF8M[Revolution OS] by next week.

Pull from me:

----
cd ~/COMP406
# The easy way
git pull upstream master
# The leet way
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
# See a CONFLICT? Unlikely at this point
git mergetool
----

Open up `prequiz.adoc` in your favorite text editor (it is in your local git repository).

WARNING: Do not use Notepad or Word.
Use a real text editor. Suggestions:
http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.7.7.html[Notepad++] (Windows),
https://atom.io/[Atom],
or http://www.sublimetext.com/[Sublime].

Then, save your changes and submit your work to your repository.

----
cd ~/COMP406
# The easy way
git gui &
# The leet way
git add .
git commit -m "Finished prequiz"
git push -u --all origin
----

IMPORTANT: As a professor, I tailor open source software for education;
consider an open source project to improve in this class, and your circumstances.
Think: "I need open source project X to do Y so that I can Z."
For example, you may find an open source project difficult to use in some way.
Identify the issues in the issue tracker,
advocate for fixing them with upstream (e.g., on IRC),
submit changes, and send a merge (pull) request.

=== May 6. Git and hosting setup

Step 1. Install Git and frontends

[[install-git]]
Windows:: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitextensions/[Install Git Extensions]
+
NOTE: Install MsysGit, Install KDiff, and *choose OpenSSH* (not PuTTY); otherwise,
stick to the default settings.
+
image:http://lawrancej.github.io/starterupper/images/what2install.png[Install MsysGit and KDiff]
image:http://lawrancej.github.io/starterupper/images/openssh.png[Choose OpenSSH]

Mac OS X:: http://rowanj.github.io/gitx/[Install GitX-dev], then https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/[Install XCode developer tools] which ships with git (recommended) or http://git-scm.com/download/mac[install git from here].

Linux:: http://git-scm.com/download/linux[Install git] using your package manager.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/qgit/[QGit, a git frontend] may also be available for your distribution.
+
NOTE: Don't forget to use +sudo+ with your package manager.

== Rest of class

* Reading groups, breakouts and discussion
* Study (and contribute to) an open source project
** https://openhatch.org/[Open Hatch]
** https://github.com/explore[Trending repositories]
** https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/list/public/google/gsoc2015[GSOC 2015]


== Readings

TIP: *Carefully read the first sentence of every paragraph before deciding
whether to skip or read the rest of the paragraph, since writers often
state the point upfront and then support it in subsequent sentences.*
In short, you can read quickly with high comprehension by skipping the
supporting material, if you understand the writer's point and how they write.
Of course, if you don't understand the point, then read everything carefully,
but beware of poorly written supporting material that distracts you.
Obviously, skipping later sentences doesn't always work: not all documents
fit the "topic sentence followed by supporting points" structure of essays.
For example, narratives often instead have dialogue among characters,
but those are even easier to read quickly than large walls of text.
Sometimes, bad writers put in pointless filler that doesn't go anywhere,
or even worse, bury the point in the middle of the paragraph.
Good writers understand their audience and know that to get
people to read their work, they must make their work easy to skim.
Now pause for a second: did you see what I just did here?
If you were thinking, this paragraph is itself a giant wall of text,
I could have ignored the rest, and then realized that this is all a
bit meta, then you not only understand the definition of the
word meta, but you also ignored my advice about how to speed
read, proving that you are kind of person who does the reading completely.
Obviously, reading the whole paragraph gives you some nuance that can be
rewarding, but then again, I think we can agree that the first sentence
captured the rest of this paragraph pretty well, which is why you should
have just skipped this paragraph full of inane, distracting filler.
